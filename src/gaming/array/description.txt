There is a game. You have an array of  distinct integers. The rules are as follows:
 - Player Bob always plays first and the two players move in alternating turns.
 - In a single move, a player chooses the maximum element currently present in the array and removes it as well as all the other elements to its right. For example, if A = [2, 3, 5, 4, 1], then it becomes A = [2,3] after the first move
 - The modifications made to the array during each turn are permanent, so the next player continues the game with the remaining array. The first player who is unable to make a move loses the game.
